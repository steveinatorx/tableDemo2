# tableDemo

This project was completed using the latest versions of react, babel (stage-0 , es7), redux, immutable, and the testing suite consists of enzyme, mocha, and chai. The seed was derived from my own react kit that i use for most UX projects.

To build and run the dev environment and tests on a local machine requires newer versions node and npm.

1. git clone git@github.com:steveinatorx/tableDemo2.git
2. cd tableDemo2
3. npm install
4. npm run dev:hot

npm run dev:hot should launch a local server at http://localhost:3000 with the app. 
This runs on the webpack server and is hot synced so it should grab a browser window and put you right into the app.

control-c will kill the server when you are finished

to run the unit tests (there are just a few 4 or 6 or so) run 
1. npm test

thanks for taking a look! if you have problems getting this to spark up feel free to ping me it should just come up as long as youve got npm and node
